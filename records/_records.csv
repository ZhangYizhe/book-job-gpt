A job type refers to the category or classification of a particular job based on various factors, such as the nature of the work, required skills, and industry. Job types help to categorize and organize different roles within the workforce. Some common job types include:\\n\\n1. <name>Full-time</name>: A full-time job typically requires a commitment of about 40 hours per week and offers benefits such as health insurance and paid time off.\\n\\n2. <name>Part-time</name>: Part-time jobs involve working fewer hours than a full-time position, often with a flexible schedule. They are suitable for individuals who prefer a reduced workload or want to balance work with other commitments.\\n\\n3. <name>Contract</name>: Contract jobs are temporary or project-based positions, usually for a specific duration or until certain tasks are completed. Contractors are often hired to work on specialized projects or to fill temporary staffing needs.\\n\\n4. <name>Freelance</name>: Freelancers are self-employed individuals who work on a project-to-project basis. They have the flexibility to choose their clients and projects and often work remotely.\\n\\n5. <name>Internship</name>: Internships provide practical work experience for students or recent graduates. They are usually temporary and aim to provide hands-on learning opportunities in a specific field.\\n\\n6. <name>Remote/Telecommuting</name>: Remote jobs allow individuals to work from a location of their choice, usually outside of a traditional office setting. They rely on technology to communicate and collaborate with colleagues.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of job types, and there are many variations and combinations depending on specific industries and organizations.\"",\""time\"":1693278282},{\""role\"":\""user\"",\""content\"":\""Thank you.\"",\""time\"":1693278383},{\""role\"":\""assistant\"",\""content\"":\""You're welcome!

It can be a great entry point into the game development industry, as it provides valuable insights into the development lifecycle and the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals.\\n\\nWhile a Software Engineering major may have a slightly different skill set compared to traditional Game Testers, their coding and problem-solving abilities can be beneficial in identifying complex technical issues and providing helpful feedback to the development team.\"",\""time\"":1693278563}]}""}","{""interviewQuestionnaire"":""{\""title\"":\""Final
